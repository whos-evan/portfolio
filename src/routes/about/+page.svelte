  <p>
    Hello! My name is Evan and I'm a software developer. I'm currently a student
    in the United States. Some of my hobbies are: gaming, web development, and
    trolling. I have strong beliefs in open source software, privacy, and a
    free/fair internet.

    If you want to contact me this is the wrong window for that.
